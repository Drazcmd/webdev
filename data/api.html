<h2>Using the COMP 431/531 Dummy Server</h2>

<p>The "dummy" server is a &quot;persistence-less&quot; back-end server for your
use while developing your front-end web application.  Later you will
develop your own back-end server and connect your front-end web app to it.</p>

<p>The server uses simple password authentication and registers a cookie in the browser
after a successful login.  Cookie management is handled entirely by the server and
browser, no front-end logic is required.</p>

<p>There are four access mechanisms to use the dummy server</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use a command line utility, such as <code>curl</code></li>
  <li>Use a browser plugin like 
  <a target=_blank href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo?hl=en-US">Advanced REST Client</a> or 
  <a target=_blank href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en-US">Postman</a></li>
  <li>Use the <a href="/comp431/sample/swagger/#/default" target=_blank>swagger user interface</a></li>
  <li>Use your server connected front-end web app</li>
</ol>

<h4>Using CURL to communicate with the server</h4>
<p>Before you start implementing your front-end connection, try using curl to connect to the server.  In particular, let's change our status headline.  We'll start by getting the current status</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
curl https://webdev-dummy.herokuapp.com/headlines
</pre>
<p>Ah ha! We need to login first!</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://webdev-dummy.herokuapp.com/login \
    -d '{"username":"netid", "password":"three-word-passphrase"}' -i
</pre>
<p>(I've added a new line and \ for display purposes, you do not need the \ or the new line.)
This performs a <code>POST</code> (the data flag makes it a post by default) to the <code>/login</code> endpoint.  The payload is JSON, we inform the server it's JSON with the content-type header.  Be sure to pass properly formed JSON, this means keys are quoted.  The <code>-i</code> flag shows us the response headers.  If successful, we should see two <code>Set-Cookie</code> statements in the header.  We now pass those two authentication cookies when communicating with the server:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --cookie 'sessionId=12345; hash=222333444' \
    https://webdev-dummy.herokuapp.com/headlines
</pre>
<p>You should get back your current status headline from this <code>GET</code> request.  Now we change it:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --cookie 'sessionId=12345; hash=222333444' \
    https://webdev-dummy.herokuapp.com/headline -X PUT -d '{ "headline":"A new headline!" }'
</pre>
<p>Headline updating is an atomic action.  Therefore we use the <code>PUT</code> verb instead of the default <code>POST</code>.  Notice that we again pass JSON as the payload (the <code>-d</code> flag).  The server should respond with the updated headline message.  We can then reverify by the previous <code>GET</code> request.
</p>

<h4>Using a browser based REST client to communicate with the server</h4>
<p>Using a browser based rest client allows for a lot of ease in debugging processes. 
I recommend you adopt either the Advanced REST Client or Postman Chrome extension for use
when verifying communicataion with the server.  In particular, you'll likely run into 
issues where your payload as produced from your front-end webapp is not correct.  Use
the browser based REST client to verify what your payload should be and what the response is.</p>

<p>Similar to the command line interaction, you will first need to login to the server.  This returns
a cookie.  Using cookies in a browser based REST client is non-trivial.  Instead, I permit the
cookie to be passed as an authorization header.  Below I use Advanced REST Client.  First
we login to the server with our netid and three-word-passphrase</p>
<img src="../images/dummy-login.png">
<p>Look for the cookies in the response</p>
<img src="../images/dummy-cookie.png">
<p>Send these cookies on all future requests.  For example, here's changing the status headline (note that "status" should be replaced by "headline" in the image below)</p>

<h3>Picture Uploading</h3>
</a>
<p>
To upload a picture we first need to have the user select a file.
For example we could have a file input on our page:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  &lt;input type="file" accept="image/*" 
     onChange={(e) => handleImageChange(e)/&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Investigate the event object sent to the onChange method.
In particular you should find files within the target
of the event.  The file is what you are after.
What does the file look like?  What kind of object is it?
</p>
<p>
Once you have the file bytestream, you'll
want to upload it.  
In general the server expects json, but
for this request we need to use a different content-type because we will be uploading a form.  In fact, we want the content-type to be auto generated based on the payload.
</p>
For json uploads we set options:
<pre class="prettyprint">
fetch(url, {
     headers: {
          'Content-Type' : 'application/json'
     },
     body: JSON.stringify(payload)
})
</pre>
for non-json uplods:
<pre class="prettyprint">
fetch(url, {
     body: payload
})
</pre>
<p>The payload we send needs to be form data.  
Form data is, again, key-value pairs.
The server expects data in specific keys.
For our article posts we send "text" and/or "image"
and for avatar uploads we only send "image".
Here is how to create and populate a form data object:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
     const fd = new FormData()
     fd.append('text', message)
     fd.append('image', file)
</pre>
<p>"fd" is the payload sent to the fetch call.
The keys in the form data are <em>very</em> important: they are what the sever is looking for.  So whereas you can change the names "message" and "file" you need the form to have "image" and "text" in order for your article or for your avatar upload to succeed.  You'll get an error message from the server otherwise.
</p>
<p>With this you should be able to upload your avatar images and post articles with imbedded images</p>
