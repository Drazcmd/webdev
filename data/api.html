<h2>Using the COMP 431/531 Dummy Server</h2>

<p>The "dummy" server is a &quot;persistence-less&quot; back-end server for your
use while developing your front-end web application.  Later you will
develop your own back-end server and connect your front-end web app to it.</p>

<p>The server uses simple password authentication and registers a cookie in the browser
after a successful login.  Cookie management is handled entirely by the server and
browser, no front-end logic is required.</p>

<p>There are three access mechanisms to use the dummy server</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use a command line utility, such as <code>curl</code></li>
  <li>Use a browser plugin like 
  <a target=_blank href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo?hl=en-US">Advanced REST Client</a> or 
  <a target=_blank href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en-US">Postman</a></li>
  <li>Use your server connected front-end web app</li>
</ol>

<h4>Using CURL to communicate with the server</h4>
<p>Before you start implementing your front-end connection, try using curl to connect to the server.  In particular, let's change our status headline.  We'll start by getting the current status</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
curl https://webdev-dummy.herokuapp.com/status
</pre>
<p>Ah ha! We need to login first!</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://webdev-dummy.herokuapp.com/login \
    -d '{"username":"netid", "password":"three-word-passphrase"}' -i
</pre>
<p>(I've added a new line and \ for display purposes, you do not need the \ or the new line.)
This performs a <code>POST</code> (the data flag makes it a post by default) to the <code>/login</code> endpoint.  The payload is JSON, we inform the server it's JSON with the content-type header.  Be sure to pass properly formed JSON, this means keys are quoted.  The <code>-i</code> flag shows us the response headers.  If successful, we should see two <code>Set-Cookie</code> statements in the header.  We now pass those two authentication cookies when communicating with the server:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --cookie 'sessionId=12345; hash=222333444' \
    https://webdev-dummy.herokuapp.com/status
</pre>
<p>You should get back your current status headline from this <code>GET</code> request.  Now we change it:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --cookie 'sessionId=12345; hash=222333444' \
    https://webdev-dummy.herokuapp.com/status -X PUT -d '{ "status":"A new headline!" }'
</pre>
<p>Status updating is an atomic action.  Therefore we use the <code>PUT</code> verb instead of the default <code>POST</code>.  Notice that we again pass JSON as the payload (the <code>-d</code> flag).  The server should respond with the updated status message.  We can then reverify by the previous <code>GET</code> request.
</p>

<h4>Using a browser based REST client to communicate with the server</h4>
<p>Using a browser based rest client allows for a lot of ease in debugging processes. 
I recommend you adopt either the Advanced REST Client or Postman Chrome extension for use
when verifying communicataion with the server.  In particular, you'll likely run into 
issues where your payload as produced from your front-end webapp is not correct.  Use
the browser based REST client to verify what your payload should be and what the response is.</p>

<p>Similar to the command line interaction, you will first need to login to the server.  This returns
a cookie.  Using cookies in a browser based REST client is non-trivial.  Instead, I permit the
cookie to be passed as an authorization header.  Below I use Advanced REST Client.  First
we login to the server with our netid and three-word-passphrase</p>

<p>Look for the cookies in the response</p>
<img src="../images/dummy-cookie.png">
<p>Send these cookies on all future requests.  For example, here's changing the status headline</p>

<h3>Picture Uploading</h3>
</a>
<p>
To upload a picture we first need to have the user select a file.
For example we could have a file input on our page:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  &lt;input type="file" accept="image/*" 
         onchange="angular.element(this).scope().vm.setFile(this)" &gt;
</pre>
<p>
Note that the file input doesn't play well with Angular.  So we include an onchange directive to execute the <code>setFile()</code> method of our controller.  That method takes in the element.  Look at the member variables of that element, you'll find the file there.  
In fact it's a complete file object with size and other useful information.
</p>
<p>
Now we need to do the upload.  We're using <code>$resource</code> and need to make a small modification for the uploading of the file.  The server expects json, so we need to make our request with a different content-type.  In fact, we want it to be auto generated based on the payload.  In our api declaration have this:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
$resource(...     
     upload: { 
          method: 'POST', 
          headers: { 'Content-Type': undefined },
          transformRequest: resourceUploadFile,
          params: { ... }
     }
})
</pre>
<p>What does this do?  This sets the header to be automatically
determined by the payload.  The transformRequest does some processing for us.  When we call <code>api.upload()</code> we will supply it with our payload.  Perhaps that looks like:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
     api.upload({ body: postBody, img: postImage })
</pre>
<p>See we'll be using the same "style" of upload for both the picture (avatar) upload as well as the post upload.  In one case body is empty.  We transform this json into form data to send to the server.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
function resourceUploadFile(data) {
     var fd = new FormData()  
     fd.append('image', data.img)
     fd.append('body', data.body)
     return fd;
}
</pre>
<p>The keys in the form data are <em>very</em> important: they are what the sever is looking for.  So whereas you can change the names "data.img" and "data.body" you need the form to have "image" and "body" in order for your post or for your avatar upload to succeed.  You'll get an error message from the server otherwise.
</p>
<p>With this you should be able to upload your avatar images and make posts with imbedded images</p>
