<h3>Picture Uploading</h3>
</a>
<p>
To upload a picture we first need to have the user select a file.
For example we could have a file input on our page:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  &lt;input type="file" accept="image/*" 
         onchange="angular.element(this).scope().vm.setFile(this)" &gt;
</pre>
<p>
Note that the file input doesn't play well with Angular.  So we include an onchange directive to execute the <code>setFile()</code> method of our controller.  That method takes in the element.  Look at the member variables of that element, you'll find the file there.  
In fact it's a complete file object with size and other useful information.
</p>
<p>
Now we need to do the upload.  We're using <code>$resource</code> and need to make a small modification for the uploading of the file.  The server expects json, so we need to make our request with a different content-type.  In fact, we want it to be auto generated based on the payload.  In our api declaration have this:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
$resource(...     
     upload: { 
          method: 'POST', 
          headers: { 'Content-Type': undefined },
          transformRequest: resourceUploadFile,
          params: { ... }
     }
})
</pre>
<p>What does this do?  This sets the header to be automatically
determined by the payload.  The transformRequest does some processing for us.  When we call <code>api.upload()</code> we will supply it with our payload.  Perhaps that looks like:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
     api.upload({ body: postBody, img: postImage })
</pre>
<p>See we'll be using the same "style" of upload for both the picture (avatar) upload as well as the post upload.  In one case body is empty.  We transform this json into form data to send to the server.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
function resourceUploadFile(data) {
     var fd = new FormData()  
     fd.append('image', data.img)
     fd.append('body', data.body)
     return fd;
}
</pre>
<p>The keys in the form data are very important: they are what the sever is looking for.  So whereas you can change the names "data.img" and "data.body" you need the form to have "image" and "body" in order for your post or for your avatar upload to succeed.  You'll get an error message from the server otherwise.
</p>
<p>With this you should be able to upload your avatar images and make posts with imbedded images</p>
