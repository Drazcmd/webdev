<h2>Using Windows in COMP 431 / COMP 531</h2>

<p>
The Windows operating system poses a collection of challenges for web developers.  Naively
everything should work out of the box.  However, much of what we do in web development utilizes
the command line.  Additionally, compiling from source sometimes poses problems.  Heroku for example
requires Ruby, and we also utilize some Python -- so we have lots of resources that are desired.
It has been 50-50 if Windows environments "work" or require a lot of "work".
</p>
<p>In Windows there are a few options:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Windows command prompt</li>
    <li>Cygwin bash</li>
    <li>Git bash</li>
    <li>Windows Ubuntu bash</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the command prompt alone might work, but you might find yourself feeling like you're translating languages.</p>
<p>Personally I use Cygwin in Windows land.
This being said, I typically have to re-engineer my solutions for every Windows machine I
touch.  I.e., my Cygwin setup on my desktop is different than the Cygwin setup on my laptop.
This requires a great deal of dedication and persistence.
</p>
<p>Git bash may be a good solution, but I have not spent much time with it given that I already have Cygwin.</p>
<p>The last item in the list is very intriguing, but is still rather new, and I don't yet have any feedback to give you on it.</p>

<h3>Virtual Machine</h3>
<p>A gauranteed solution is to use a virtual machine (VM) and run Linux within it.
I recommend the most recent version of Ubuntu available on the <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads" target="_blank">linux downloads page</a>.
The instructional staff can provide some assistance in getting your VM running and configured, but you are advised to following
the documentation and see if you can get it running yourself.
In particular, you will likely want to have some shared drive between the VM and your Windows machine, as well as forward ports so that you can access
your VM's website from your Windows browser.</p>
