<em>This assignment is for students enrolled in COMP531.</em>
<p>
For this assignment you will write a paper, prepare a presentation, and deliver that presentation the last week of class.
</p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>You will investigate a <em>topic</em> and submit it for approval.  The <em>topic</em> is fairly open 
but naturally should be related to web development and/or web design.  You could
present a detailed study of a new technolgy or aspect of the web, you could compare and
contrast two or three technology choices, you could investigate a topic on web security
or e-commerce, or how big data is being used today and the potentials for the future.  
Or you could present a study of user experience in different website designs, or a comparison 
of how certain design details impact the usability of a website.  Or you could research ARIA and
tell us all about why we should or should not include ARIA tags.  Or you could provide
a retrospective on a past leading technology, what it promised, what it delivered, but then how 
it fell short to technologies that superceded it (e.g., Java Applets, Flash, or Ruby on Rails).</p>
<p>
What is important is that your <em>topic</em> is meaningful and allows you to demonstrate your
ability to critically think about some topic related to web development or design and convey 
an analysis of said <em>topic</em>.</p>
<p>
For example,
you might research about upcoming new technologies such as ReactJS and present a comparison
of it with AngularJS.  But it needs to be more than a laundry list.  You need to demonstrate
an understanding of the two technologies, how they are similar, how they are different, and
make a case for why we should use one over the other.  It's no good just to compare and constrast
without some critical understanding and critique.</p>

<p>Do some hunting around and come up with an idea.  Present it to me in an email for approval.
There will be no duplicate <em>topics</em>, so the sooner you pin yours down the better.</p>

<h3>Paper</h3>
<p>Once you have been approved, write a <strong>1000 to 2000 word paper</strong> on your <em>topic</em>.  
Pay special attention that the contents of your paper focus on critical analysis and not just
describing the <em>topic</em> (we can all read wikipedia).  Be sure to proof read your paper.  You are
invited to have your peers read your papers and give you suggestions and comments, but of course
you are doing all of the writing yourself.</p>

<h3>Presentation</h3>
<p>During the last week of the course you will deliver a <strong>6 minute presentation</strong> on your <em>topic</em>.
Presumably you will require some presentation materials to facillitate.  These may be slides (you might checkout react.js for this), selected web sites, what ever you would like.  Whatever presentation materials you develop, submit these along with your paper.  If it's just a list of websites, then submit a text file that has these website urls and a short description (1-3 sentences) of what content 
you will highlight on the sites (i.e., what will you be doing with these sites, what will you say).
</p>

<p>Turnin both your paper and your presentation materials.</p>
