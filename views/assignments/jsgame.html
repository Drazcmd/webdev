<h1 style="color: red;">NOT UP TO DATE</h1>
<p>
In this assignment you will create a JavaScript game to be played in a browser to demonstrate your understanding of dynamic HTML and CSS with JavaScript.  Whereas this assignment is open ended, we should focus on meeting the specified requirements more than adding extra bells and whistles or making the game look really good (there are other classes focused on game design) -- in particular because we only have two weeks to work on this assignment!
</p>
<p>Use Chrome as your standard supported browser.  (Whereas you can use any browser you like for development, your assignment will be accessed using Chrome by the grading staff and therefore it behooves you that it works.)</p>

<h4>Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>Your game idea is approved by confirmation from the instructor through email or a post on piazza (be sure to include as much description for your game as possible).</li>
<li>Write unobstrusive JavaScript and CSS, i.e., separate js, css, and html to files with their respective content.</li>
<li>Playable by a single player alone</li>
<li>Playable in a short sitting, i.e., 10 minutes or less</li>
<li>A visual game, i.e., the game should involve moving graphics and use the mouse to interact.  Some keyboard usage is permissible.</li>
<li>Includes a "score" that is updated as the user plays</li>
<li>Has a dynamic aspect to it, e.g., difficulty becomes harder or easier, perhaps at random or as the user progresses in the game</li>
<li>include something unique about you in the game, i.e., make the game your own</li>
</ul>

<p>Include in your submission a screenshot of your game in action.  The image should be no larger than 250x250, it should be a png file.</p>

<p>After submission, games will be made availble for everyone in the class to try out and play.  Therefore each game should strive to be unique (i.e., everyone cannot submit tic-tac-toe) therefore your 
game idea must be pre-approved.</p>

<h4>Example Ideas</h4>
<p>
Below are some example ideas for games that you might create.  Remember the Rice Honor code: you write the code yourself do not copy the code for a game from the internet.  There are <em>lots</em> of games out there, take a look on the iPhone or Android app store, and you are free to search for inspiration (just remember the honor code).
</p>
<ul>
	<li>tic-tac-toe (don't pick this one)</li>
	<li>catch the fly</li>
	<li>whack-a-mole</li>
	<li>hangman</li>
	<li>duck hunt</li>
	<li>space invaders</li>
	<li>an arithmetic game</li>
	<li>memory</li>
	<li>race game</li>
	<li>maze game</li>
	<li>angry birds clone</li>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.clear.rice.edu/comp431/games/past/">Previous term submissions</a></li>
</ul>

<p>To give you an idea about how a game like one of these satisfy the spirit of the assignment, demonstrating your knowledge and application of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, let's look at the first game in detail:</p>
<ul>
	<li>We use HTML and CSS to display a tic-tac-toe board</li>
	<li>We use JavaScript to keep track of the state of the board, and the logic for the computer moves.</li>
	<li>We have event handlers listening for mouse clicks and manipulate the DOM to add X's and O's to the page when a player makes a move</li>
	<li>When the game is over, we use JavaScript to inform the user of the outcome</li>
	<li>We use HTML/CSS/JS to maintain a score board showing the user's score as compared with the computer's and ties, as well as metrics such as how long it took the user to win on average compared with the average time for losses or ties</li>
	<li>The computer starts off making poor moves, but as the user performs proficiently, the computer AI becomes more selective in it's choices</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Remember to be creative and make the game your own.</u></p>

<p>
Your solution will contain at least one HTML file, one CSS file, and one JavaScript file.  Depending on the complexity of your game you may have more than one of each of these files.
