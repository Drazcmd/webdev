<p>We will construct our social networking application iteratively.  In this first assignment we create a web page that may act as our landing page, i.e., the first page that users will
see when they come to our app.  This page
will contain a registration form for users to create an account.  Additionally we will create a web page to process the user input.</p>

<p>Use Chrome as your standard supported browser.</p>

<h5>Registration Page Requirements</h5>
<p>Save this page as <code>index.html</code></p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>form</code> with text fields for user's</li>
<ul>            
  <div class="ui horizontal bulleted list">                
    <span class="item"></span>
    <span class="item">account name</span>
    <span class="item">display name (optional)</span>
    <span class="item">email address</span>
    <span class="item">phone number</span>
    <span class="item">date of birth</span>
    <span class="item">zipcode</span>
    <span class="item">password</span>
    <span class="item">password confirmation</span>      
  </div>              
</ul>
<li>Clear button that empties all fields</li>
<li>Submit button that performs validation on the form</li>
<li>There should also be a hidden field that contains the current timestamp in millis (i.e., since epoch) when the submit button is pressed.</li>
<ul>
  <li>All fields are required except those that are optional.</li>
  <li>Fields should be validated for proper content, i.e., valid phone number, valid email address.  [These do not need to be exhaustive, e.g., a@b.co is a "valid" email]</li>
  <li>Account name can only be upper or lower case letters and numbers, but may not start with a number</li>
  <li>validate password equality with confirmation field.</li>
  <li>leave a stub to check if the account name is available</li>
</ul>
<li>If the form is not valid then use an alert or some other mechanism to inform the user what specifically is wrong</li>
<li>The submit button makes a GET request to the form processor page (see below) with the form contents</li>
</ul>

<h5>Form Processor Requirements</h5>
<ul>
<li>Extract the query parameter from the location and display the key-value pairs in a table</li>
<li>The &quot;hidden field&quot; timestamp should be rendered as a human readable datetime</li>
</ul>

<div class="ui section divider"></div>

<p>
For this assignment you should write <em>obtrusive</em> JavaScript, i.e., all script will
be included within your html files rather than in a separate js file.
</p>


<h2>What to submit</h2>

<p>Your submission directory should look like this</p>

<div class="ui list"><div class="item">
    <i class="folder icon"></i>
    <div class="content">
        <div class="header">hw1-simple</div>
        <div class="list">

            <div class="item">
                <i class="file text outline icon"></i>
                <div class="content"><div class="description">index.html</div></div>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <i class="file text outline icon"></i>
                <div class="content"><div class="description">formProcessor.html</div></div>
            </div>

        </div>
    </div>
</div>
